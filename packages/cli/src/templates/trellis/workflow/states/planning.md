Load the `trellis-brainstorm` skill and iterate on prd.md with the user.
Phase 1.3 (required, once): before `task.py start`, you MUST curate `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` — list the spec / research files sub-agents need so they get the right context injected. You may skip only if the jsonl already has agent-curated entries (the seed `_example` row alone doesn't count).
Then run `task.py start <task-dir>` to flip status to in_progress.

### Rules

1. Identify which Phase you're in, then continue from the next step there
2. Run steps in order inside each Phase; `[required]` steps can't be skipped
3. Phases can roll back (e.g., Execute reveals a prd defect → return to Plan to fix, then re-enter Execute)
4. Steps tagged `[once]` are skipped if the output already exists; don't re-run

### Skill Routing

When a user request matches one of these intents, load the corresponding skill (or dispatch the corresponding sub-agent) first — do not skip skills.

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

| User intent | Route |
|---|---|
| Wants a new feature / requirement unclear | `trellis-brainstorm` |
| About to write code / start implementing | Dispatch the `trellis-implement` sub-agent per Phase 2.1 |
| Finished writing / want to verify | Dispatch the `trellis-check` sub-agent per Phase 2.2 |
| Stuck / fixed same bug several times | `trellis-break-loop` |
| Spec needs update | `trellis-update-spec` |

**Why `trellis-before-dev` is NOT in this table:** you are not the one writing code — the `trellis-implement` sub-agent is. Sub-agent platforms get spec context via `implement.jsonl` injection / prelude, not via the main thread loading `trellis-before-dev`.

| User intent | Skill |
|---|---|
| Wants a new feature / requirement unclear | `trellis-brainstorm` |
| About to write code / start implementing | `trellis-before-dev` (then implement directly in the main session) |
| Finished writing / want to verify | `trellis-check` |
| Stuck / fixed same bug several times | `trellis-break-loop` |
| Spec needs update | `trellis-update-spec` |

### DO NOT skip skills

| What you're thinking | Why it's wrong |
|---|---|
| "This is simple, I'll just code it in the main thread" | Dispatching `trellis-implement` is the cheap path; skipping it tempts you to write code in the main thread and lose spec context — sub-agents get `implement.jsonl` injected, you don't |
| "I already thought it through in plan mode" | Plan-mode output lives in memory — sub-agents can't see it; must be persisted to prd.md |
| "I already know the spec" | The spec may have been updated since you last read it; the sub-agent gets the fresh copy, you may not |
| "Code first, check later" | `trellis-check` surfaces issues you won't notice yourself; earlier is cheaper |

| What you're thinking | Why it's wrong |
|---|---|
| "This is simple, just code it" | Simple tasks often grow complex; `trellis-before-dev` takes under a minute and loads the spec context you'll need |
| "I already thought it through in plan mode" | Plan-mode output lives in memory — must be persisted to prd.md before code |
| "I already know the spec" | The spec may have been updated since you last read it; read again |
| "Code first, check later" | `trellis-check` surfaces issues you won't notice yourself; earlier is cheaper |
